Run, compare, visualize, and track machine learning experiments right in VS
Code. This extension uses open-source tool [DVC](https://dvc.org/) and does not
require additional services or databases. It enables other DVC features as well!

- **Experiment bookkeeping**: Activate a visual system to record training data,
  parameters, and metrics on top of [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Use it to
  navigate your experiments, compare their results, and find the best ML model.
- **Visualization**: Plot experiment data in a customizable View.
- **Live tracking**: Capture and see metrics changing in real time.
- **Reproducibility**: Reliably get back to any previous experiment. Run it
  again or use it as the base for new experiments.
- **Data Management**: Handle large datasets, files, and models effectively.

> **Note**: We are in public beta and welcome early adopter feedback!  
> Feel free to open [issues] or reach out to [DVC support].

### Why use this extension?

- Enjoy the best developer experience with the first experiment tracking
  interface for an IDE.
- No external servers, databases, subscriptions, etc. Data stays fully under
  your control and your existing Git hosting is used to share and collaborate.
- Go beyond a simple metrics dashboard with complete ML experiments that include
  metrics, code, and data. Powered by [DVC experiment versioning].
- Implement [data versioning] on top of your favorite cloud storage, such as
  Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, NFS, etc.

## UI components

This [extension] augments and adds several [Views], adds special [Editors] to VS
Code. It also exposes these and other DVC functions in the [Command Palette].

- Provides _Editors_ to manage [Experiments][exp-view] and display
  [Plots][plots-view] as _Tabs_ in the IDE.
- Adds a [DVC Tracked] panel to the _Explorer_ view. This shows a tree of the
  data that DVC is tracking, with real-time file/dir [states] and options to
  [synchronize] them (from/to remote storage).
- Adds a [DVC panel] to the _Source Control_ view to list the [workspace
  status]. You can [restore] or reset project versions (based on the current Git
  `HEAD` commit) as well as [manage new and existing data] from here.
- Adds a brand-new [DVC View] (<img

  alt="DVC logo" style="height: 1em;"/> icon in the Activity Bar) with panels to
  visualize and manage [DVC Experiments].
- Registers several [commands] in the _Command Palette_.
- Includes a [DVC channel] for the _Output_ panel (useful for
  [debugging](#debugging)).

## Debugging

### The DVC Extension

Please see the DVC [channel] in the IDE's _Output_ panel to see the underlying
DVC commands being run, as wel as their error output. Feel free to share this
with us via [DVC support].

[channel]:
  https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-capabilities/common-capabilities#output-channel

### Your DVC project

Due to the way DVC pipelines run scripts of any language from the command line,
users must debug pipeline scripts (e.g. `train.py`) standalone in whatever way
debuggers are run on the base language - this is standard for debugging DVC
pipelines, and most scripts are capable of running outside of DVC.

## Data and telemetry

The DVC Extension for Visual Studio Code collects usage data and sends it to
Azure to help improve our products and services. This extension respects the
`telemetry.enableTelemetry` setting which you can learn more about at
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting.
