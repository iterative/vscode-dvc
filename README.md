Run, compare, visualize, and track machine learning experiments right in VS
Code. This extension uses [DVC](https://dvc.org/), an open-source data
versioning and ML experiment management tool. No additional services or
databases are required.

![Extension Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iterative/vscode-dvc/main/extension/docs/overview.gif)

- **Experiment tracking**: Record training data, parameters, and metrics on top
  of [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Navigate your experiments, compare their
  results, and find the best ML models.
- **Visualization**: Plot performance data in a customizable dashboard including
  one or more overlaid experiments.
- **Live tracking**: Capture and see metrics changing in real time.
- **Reproducibility**: Make sure that anyone can recover or confirm previous
  experiments, and run new experiments based on their results.
- **Data Management**: Handle and version large datasets, files, and models
  effectively right from VS Code.

> **Note**: We are in public beta and welcome early adopter feedback!  
> Feel free to reach out [via Discord] or open [issues in GitHub].

### Why prefer this extension?

- Enjoy the best developer experience with the first experiment tracking
  interface for an IDE.
- No external servers, databases, subscriptions, etc. Data stays fully under
  your control and your existing Git hosting is used to share and collaborate.
- Go beyond a simple metrics dashboard with complete ML experiments that include
  metrics, code, and data. Powered by [DVC experiment
  versioning][dvc experiments].
- Implement [data versioning] on top of your favorite cloud storage, such as
  Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, NFS, etc.

## What you get

This extension augments VS Code in the following ways:

- Adds a brand-new new **[DVC View]** (<img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iterative/vscode-dvc/main/extension/docs/dvc.png"
  alt="DVC logo" height="16"/> icon in the Activity Bar) with panels to
  visualize and manage [DVC Experiments].
- Provides special _Editors_ to manage **[Experiments]** and display **[Plots]**
  in IDE _Tabs_.
- Adds a **[DVC Tracked]** panel to the _Explorer_ view. This shows a tree of
  the data files and directories tracked by DVC, including their state, and
  options to [synchronize] them (from/to remote storage).
- Adds a **[DVC panel]** to the _Source Control_ view to display the [workspace
  status]. You can [restore] or reset project versions (based on the current Git
  `HEAD` commit) as well as manage new and existing data from here.
- Registers several **Commands** in the _[Command Palette]_ (see next section).
- Includes a DVC channel for the _Output_ panel (useful for
  [debugging](#debugging)).

| `dvc.dvcPath`                          | Path or shell command to the DVC binary. Required unless Microsoft's [Python extension] is installed and the `dvc` package found in its environment.     |
| `dvc.pythonPath`                       | Path to the desired Python interpreter to use with DVC. Should only be utilized when using a virtual environment without Microsoft's [Python extension]. |
| `dvc.experimentsTableHeadMaxHeight`    | Maximum height of experiment table head rows.                                                                                                            |
| `dvc.focusedProjects`                  | A subset of paths to the workspace's available DVC projects. Using this option will override project auto-discovery.                                     |
| `dvc.doNotShowWalkthroughAfterInstall` | Do not prompt to show the Get Started page after installing. Useful for pre-configured development environments                                          |
| `dvc.doNotRecommendRedHatExtension`    | Do not prompt to install the Red Hat YAML extension, which helps with DVC YAML schema validation (`dvc.yaml` and `.dvc` files).                          |
| `dvc.doNotShowCliUnavailable`          | Do not warn when the workspace contains a DVC project but the DVC binary is unavailable.                                                                 |
| `dvc.doNotShowUnableToFilter`          | Do not warn before disabling auto-apply filters when these would result in too many experiments being selected.                                          |

> **Note** that the `Setup The Workspace` command helps you set up the basic

## Debugging

### The DVC Extension

Please see the DVC [channel] in the IDE's _Output_ panel to see the underlying
DVC commands being run, as well as their error output. Feel free to share this
with us [via Discord] or use it to report [issues in GitHub].

[channel]:
  https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-capabilities/common-capabilities#output-channel

### Your DVC project

Due to the way DVC pipelines run scripts of any language from the command line,
users must debug pipeline scripts (e.g. `train.py`) standalone in whatever way
debuggers are run on the base language - this is standard for debugging DVC
pipelines, and most scripts are capable of running outside of DVC.

## Data and telemetry

The DVC Extension for Visual Studio Code collects usage data and sends it to
Azure to help improve our products and services. This extension respects the
`telemetry.enableTelemetry` setting which you can learn more about at
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting.
