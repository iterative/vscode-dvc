A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
[extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) that aims to allow
users of all technical backgrounds to effectively use [DVC](https://dvc.org/).

## Current State

This project is currently in closed alpha testing, and constantly evolving.
After we conclude alpha and beta testing the repository will become public.

## Quick Start

- **Step 1.**
  [Install a supported version of DVC on your system](https://dvc.org/doc/install)
- **Step 2.**
  [Install the DVC extension for Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery).
- **Step 3.** See walkthrough.

**Note:** You will be prompted to open our walkthrough after installation. If
for any reason you need to revisit the walkthrough, open the command palette
(⇧⌃P on Windows/Linux or ⇧⌘P on macOS) and select the `DVC: Get Started`
command.

## Features

- [Command Palette](extension/resources/walkthrough/command-palette.md)
- [Source Control Management](extension/resources/walkthrough/source-control-management.md)
- [Tracked Resources](extension/resources/walkthrough/tracked-explorer.md)
- [DVC View Container](extension/resources/walkthrough/view-container.md)
- [Experiments Table](extension/resources/walkthrough/experiments-table.md)
- [Plots](extension/resources/walkthrough/plots.md)

### Debugging

Due to the way DVC pipelines run scripts of any language from the command line,
users must debug pipeline scripts (e.g. `train.py`) standalone in whatever way
debuggers are run on the base language - this is standard for debugging DVC
pipelines, and most scripts are capable of running outside of DVC.

## Data and telemetry

The DVC Extension for Visual Studio Code collects usage data and sends it to
Azure to help improve our products and services. This extension respects the
`telemetry.enableTelemetry` setting which you can learn more about at
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting.
