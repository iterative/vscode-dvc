## Development environment

Setting up a dev environment allows contributors to test changes to this
extension. The source code is built, and the resulting package loaded into a
special instance of VS Code.

First, ensure that [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) are installed.

- Open this repository as a project in VS Code.

- Run `Tasks: Run Build Task` (Shift + Ctrl/Cmd + `b`) to start the extension
  and Webview dev servers (alternatively, run `yarn dev-server` from the
  _Integrated Terminal_).

  > **Warning**: Having a separate `.vsix` version of this extension installed
  > may cause all kinds of chaos in your development environment.

- **Start Debugging** (F5) to open the [Extension Development Host], a child
  instance of VS Code with the local extension build installed.

  > **Note**: using the `Run Extension` command when running the debugger will
  > prevent all other extensions from loading into VS Code. This will improve
  > the performance of VS Code but can cause certain DVC commands to fail if the
  > DVC project uses an isolated Python env (see [this warning](#warning)).

- Open a DVC project in the _Extension Development Host_. VS Code will remember
  the last project opened, so this step only has to be done once.

  > **Note**: We have provided a demo project as part of this repo, but feel
  > free to use any DVC project that you have available.

## The demo project

The [demo project](demo) is provided as a lightweight, convenient testbed to try
your changes to this extension.

> **Note**: It is not an exhaustive showcase of DVC's features. Testers are
> encouraged to try other DVC repositories -- especially real-world cases!

- Run `yarn setup:venv` from the _Terminal_ in the root of this repo to set up a
  Python virtual environment for the demo project (in `demo/.env`).

- Open the `./demo` project in a VS Code window, for example in the _Extension
  Development Host_ (see previous section).

- Pull the project data using this extension (either from the **DVC Tracked**
  panel in the _File Explorer_ or the **DVC panel** in _Source Control_) or by
  running `dvc pull` from _Terminal_.

- In order to [run experiments] in the demo project, the [Python extension]
  should be installed so that the virtual env is activated.

> **Warning**: When using any project that relies on an isolated Python
> environment (`conda`, `venv`, etc.), Microsoft's Python extension is required.
> It's used by this extension to locate and utilize the required environment.

## React component development with Storybook

Start Storybook with `yarn storybook` in either the root of this repo or in the
`webview` project. You can develop the React components this plugin uses without
requiring VS Code as a dev environment.

There are some discrepancies between the Storybook environment and the
environment of a real VS Code extension, custom themes being a big one. Always
make sure to try out changed components in the full dev environment before
merging!
