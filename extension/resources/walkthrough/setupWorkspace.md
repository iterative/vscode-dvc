# Integrating with the CLI

This extension can support DVC being installed either globally or within some
type of virtual environment.

Use the workspace setup wizard to set the config options required by your setup.
This can be done via the welcome view underneath the `DVC Tracked` view in the
side bar's explorer view container or `DVC: Setup The Workspace` from the
command palette.

Once you have setup your workspace the rest of the walkthrough will appear.
