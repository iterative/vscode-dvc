# Installing and Integrating With DVC CLI

As you probably already know there are quite a few options for installing DVC.

This extension can integrate with a few different setups.

Use the workspace setup wizard to set the required config options. This can be
done via the welcome view underneath the `DVC Tracked` view in the side bar's
explorer view container or `DVC: Setup The Workspace` from the command palette.

Once you have setup your workspace the rest of the walkthrough will appear.
