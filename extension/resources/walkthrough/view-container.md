# DVC Views

Click on the `DVC` icon in the
[Activity Bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) to
access the views or use
[View: Show DVC](command:workbench.view.extension.dvc-views) from the Command
Palette.

‚ùó Welcome and support views showing some getting started instructions will
appear in the container when `DVC` is not installed or if there is not a `DVC`
project available in the workspace:

<p float="left">

       alt="Welcome View" width="49%" />
  <img src="images/view-container-support.png"
       alt="Support View" width="49%" />
</p>

  <img src="images/view-container-columns.png"

  <img src="images/view-container-sort.png"

- `COLUMNS`. Used to fine-tune the experiments table to focus on the most
  important metrics, parameters, and data signals and to view all available
  columns.
- `EXPERIMENTS`. Exposes the list of experiments, their checkpoints and common
  actions.
- `SORT BY`. Used to display and configure how the experiments table is sorted.
- `FILTER BY`. Used to view, add, or remove metrics and parameters filters.
  These will hide specific experiments in the table.
- `PLOTS`. Used to fine-tune the plots dashboard, e.g. by toggling plots
  visibility.
