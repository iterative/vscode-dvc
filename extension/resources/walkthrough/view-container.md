# DVC View Container

The view container provides supplementary information and control over the
experiments and plots in the workspace.

Click on the `DVC` icon in the
[Activity Bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) to
access the container or use
[View: Show DVC](command:workbench.view.extension.dvc-views) from the Command
Palette.

A welcome view showing some getting started instructions will appear in the
container when the CLI is not accessible or if there is not a `DVC` project
available in the workspace.
