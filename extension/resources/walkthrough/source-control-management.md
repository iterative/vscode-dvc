# Source control management

Resources tracked by DVC can be managed through VS Code's builtin SCM view.

The statuses shown are designed to integrate with that of the builtin `git`
extension and give an "at a glance" state of the entire workspace.

You can `checkout`, `commit`, `add`, `push` & `pull` via this view.
