# Source control management

Resources tracked by `DVC` can be managed through the SCM view.

The statuses shown are designed to integrate with that of the built-in `git`
extension and give an "at a glance" state of the entire workspace.

You can `checkout`, `commit`, `add`, `push` & `pull` from this view.
