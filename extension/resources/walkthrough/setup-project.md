# Setup a DVC Project

> Skip this step if you already have a DVC project with metrics, plots, and
> params.

ðŸ’¡ Check out the
[DVC Get Started](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started) or
[Extension Demo](https://github.com/iterative/vscode-dvc-demo) projects to
quickly try the extension.

To quickly setup a new DVC project run
[`dvc exp init -i`](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/exp/init#example-interactive-mode)
in a [Terminal](command:workbench.action.terminal.new). It will generate a
config file `dvc.yaml` that describes the project, and will look something like
this:

</p>

ðŸ’¡ Names, values in this file are project dependent and can be customized.

DVC and this extension read experiments data from these files (e.g
`metrics.json`, `params.yaml`, etc). Your code needs to write and read to them
(the example below is Python, but it can be done in any language):

  <img src="images/setup-project-dump-metrics.png"
       alt="Dump JSON metrics file" />
</p>

Alternatively, use the [`DVCLive`](https://dvc.org/doc/dvclive) Python library,
which can read and write a lot of different common metrics and plots:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/setup-project-dvclive-metrics.png"
       alt="DVCLive: dump metrics" />
</p>
