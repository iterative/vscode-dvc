All `DVC` CLI commands generate two entries in this extension's dedicated output
channel. The first shows the command has started. The second is to signify that
it has completed.

The completion entry will show:

- The outcome of the command (COMPLETED / FAILED).
- Any non-zero exit codes.
- The length of time that each command took to run (ms).
- Any error message provided by the CLI.

Don't hesitate to ping us in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/BGCjJHvDHt)
channel or open an issue on
[GitHub](https://github.com/iterative/vscode-dvc/issues). We are happy to help
ðŸ¤—.

Please share with us the output channel logs, the extension version, and the DVC
version (the `dvc version` output).
