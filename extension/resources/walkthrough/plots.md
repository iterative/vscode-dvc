# Plots

The extension will display the following sections for selected revisions:

- Plots - the equivalent of `dvc plots diff`.
- Comparison - a table used to display images for comparison.
- Experiment Checkpoints - linear plots based on the checkpoints of selected
  experiments.

Use `DVC: Show Plots` from the command palette to open the view for a `DVC`
repository.
