# Plots

The extension will show:

- Plots - the equivalent of `dvc plots show`.
- Comparison - a table used to display images for comparison.
- Experiment Checkpoints - linear plots based on the checkpoints of selected
  experiments.

Use `DVC: Show Plots` from the command palette to show the available plots for a
DVC repository.
