# Plots

The extension will display the following sections for selected experiments:

- Data Series - JSON, YAML, CSV or TSV files visualized using Vega pre-defined
  or custom Vega-Lite templates.
- Images - a table used to display image plots side by side.
- Trends - linear plots based on data from the experiments table.

Use `DVC: Show Plots` from the Command Palette to open the view for a `DVC`
repository.

The view can be manipulated using the controls shown in the extension's view
container.
