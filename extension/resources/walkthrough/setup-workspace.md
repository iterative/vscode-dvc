# Integrating with the CLI

This extension can support a global or virtual environment installation of
`DVC`.

You will need a `DVC` project opened within the workspace to see all of the
extension's available features. See the `Explore More Resources` step for
details on creating a `DVC` project.

Use the workspace setup wizard to set the required config options. See the
welcome view underneath the `DVC Tracked` view in the side bar's explorer view
container or [DVC: Setup The Workspace](command:dvc.setupWorkspace) from the
command palette.

Once completed, the rest of the walkthrough will appear.
