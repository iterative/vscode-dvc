# Integrating with the CLI

This extension can support a global or virtual environment installation of
`DVC`.

You will need a `DVC` project opened within the workspace to see all of the
extension's available features. See the `Explore more resources` step for
details on creating a `DVC` project.

Use the workspace setup wizard to set the required config options. See the
welcome view underneath the
[DVC Tracked](command:dvc.views.trackedExplorerTree.focus) view in the side
bar's explorer view container or
[DVC: Setup The Workspace](command:dvc.setupWorkspace) from the command palette.

Once completed, the rest of the walkthrough will appear.
